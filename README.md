I want to use WASM
I do not want "bloat"
~=> No such thing as multiple buildsystems. No node.~
We use bun and Vite now. this is a bit more "bloat" but i can live with it for the sake of convenience
The algorithm is simple, I can put it on client side.
If wasm is unavailable on a device, we might load/fetch a JS- version.
All UI in JS, with some simple CSS-Framework stuff
